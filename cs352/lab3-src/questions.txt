1.  (1) We cannot declare a vaible and initalize it at the same time for SimpleC while we can do it in C.
	(2) We cannot use struct in SimpleC while it is allowed in C.
	(3) We cannot declare int for SimpleC while it is allowed in C.
	(4) The assignment, condition and update must be written and can not be empty in SimpleC for the for loop while they can be empty in C.
	(5) We doesn't implement switch statement in Simple C while switch statement can be used in C.


2. We should do this to make sure that the precedence of these operators are correct sicne different opertors has difffernt precedence. For example, Multiply: '*' executes before ADD: '+' .

3.
a. The program is not valid because int is not defined in Simple C grammar.
b. The program is not valid. It can not be "double *x" because in SimpleC, ID can not begin with a star.
c. The program is valid.
d. The program is not valid because in SimpleC grammer, we should first declare a variable and then give it a value or initailize it in a different line.
   In other words, in SimplcC, we can not declare a varaible and initalize it at the same time.
e. The program is not valid becasue in SimpleC grammer, it doesn't allow declear a new function inside a function.
f. The program is not valid because the assignment, condition and update must be written and can not be empty in SimpleC for the for loop.
